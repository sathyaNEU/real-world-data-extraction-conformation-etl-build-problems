# task482 design note

Status lives in `pipeline.json`; this note holds the design. Architecture 14, drawn 2026-10-25 after architectures 1
to 13 were spent at stage 4: architecture 13's world and decision kept (a clinically integrated network's 2027
two-sided risk elections for its thirteen independent primary care practices, each practice's 2026 total cost of care
per attributed member month projected from the payers' October interim run to their year-end attribution), with the
attribution run-out that both stage 4 readers took moved to the default path's last step (stumping 1.1b) and a new
decisive step: the members still in hospital on 31 August, whose stays the hospitals bill only at discharge and which
are already past the member cap.

## Draw

- **Card:** `.claude/skills/fingerprint/cards/task482.json` (architecture v14, lineage v1 to v13 spent), registered
  2026-10-25 after a fetch of main and checked again as filed: WARN, no BLOCK, nearest driver on file 0.16 (this slot's
  architecture 13, differentiated), the next 0.08. The window the axis bans read (task281, task170 and task301, the
  live cards filed last; task482 v13 carries `architecture_spent`) closes the strategies forecast_method_backtest,
  time_semantics and composition_mix, the forums line_manager_or_team, regulator_or_inspector and committee_or_panel,
  the forcing events budget_or_appropriation, launch_or_rollout and vote_or_meeting, the organisations
  government_agency, utility_or_infrastructure and financial_institution, the roles research_desk, compliance_or_audit
  and capacity_planner, the context artifacts filed_standard, operations_log and monitoring_export, the calibrations
  pilot_log and existing_book_actuals, and the shapes 07 and other. Architecture 13's honest labels clear all of them
  and are kept: forum board_of_directors, forcing event purchase_order_or_contract (the payers' election deadline),
  organisation hospital_or_health_provider, role portfolio_manager, shape 10, context artifact close_out_summary (the
  payers' 2025 settlement statements), calibration prior_period_close_out (the final 2025 attribution with the claims
  the network holds for it).
- **WARNs answered.** `repeat.deliverables` (png and xlsx against task281): the workbook is the board packet's exhibit
  and the practices against their thresholds read at a glance as a chart. `repeat.question_form` (which, against task301): the board names the practices it enters, so the question asks which. `test.same_puzzle_older` (time, G12,
  designation_set against task231, task234 v2 and task445's first loop): differentiated on the card, none of them a
  record whose amount for a still-running episode is not yet written. People: architecture 13's three, drawn with
  `guard.py names --geo "United States" --seed 482 --n 24` (Andre O'Connor, the network's president and requester; Joel
  Brewer, the director of payer performance analytics; Carlos Howard, Merrinlake Health Plan's provider performance
  manager), owners in file properties and sign-offs only.
- **Pairing:** Healthcare Delivery & Health Economics, task type `payment-claims-health-plan-analytics`, which serves
  ETL, as in architecture 13: three commercial payers' feeds in three layouts, the network's roster and master patient
  index and its performance standard, conformed into each practice's 2026 total cost of care per attributed member
  month on the standard's basis against its benchmark.
- **The decision and the quantity:** architecture 13's, unchanged. The Performance Standard (Exhibit B to the 2026
  shared savings agreements with Merrinlake Health Plan, Kesselcrest Benefit Partners and Pemberglen Mutual Health)
  measures a practice by the allowed amounts for covered medical and pharmacy services incurred in the year for the
  members attributed to it on the payers' final runs, each member's year capped at USD 250,000, over those members'
  months of enrollment; the board's July resolution enters a practice in the 2027 two-sided track only where its 2026
  measure comes in at least 2 per cent under its benchmark (its 2025 measure times 1.052), and the board decides on 29
  October, before the year or its attribution closes, on the network's projection of each practice's 2026 measure.
- **Shape:** `10`, a scorecard against thresholds: each practice's 2026 benchmark and threshold and whether it enters,
  beside the call; the asks are rebuilt at stage 2 (architecture 13's both fell to a reader).
- **The default path now holds the field's method (stumping 1.1b).** Conform the feeds, take the 2025 measure on the
  final runs and the thresholds, compute each practice's interim measure on the October runs (section 4.1, the payers'
  completion factors), and carry it to the year by the practice's own 2025 run-out at the same cut (the 2025
  attribution re-run on the 2025 claims at 31 August and 30 September): the projection both architecture 13 readers
  built, which enters nine practices.
- **The decisive step:** that projection carries what the year adds on average, the claims still to be paid for
  services already given (the completion factors) and the members a later visit attributes (the run-out); its
  precondition is that what is still to come for each practice is like what was still to come at the same cut in
  2025. It is not where a member is in hospital at the cut: a hospital bills a stay when it ends, so a stay open on 31
  August has no facility claim in any feed, and shows only through the daily professional claims of the physicians who
  attend it. Premature triplets in a regional neonatal unit since their birth in June (attributed to Mallowcrest
  Pediatrics through its pediatrician's newborn examination at the birth hospital) and three members of one family in
  trauma intensive care since a July crash (attributed to Garrowdale Family Practice) are each already past USD 250,000
  of care by the cut on any per-day rate the 2025 stays of the same kind carry, so each member's 2026 cost is the cap
  whatever the rest of the stay costs, and with them both practices come in over their thresholds: seven practices
  enter.
- **Strategy:** `maturity_censoring` (amounts not yet recorded at the cut, late arrival by the billing of a stay at its
  end); not binding_constraint (the cap fixes the size of the step, it does not remove a pick by itself). Gate G
  `etl_conformance`; gap `time` (decisive: the year is open and a running stay's amount is written at its end) and
  `population`; pattern none; generators G12 (decisive: a stay with no facility claim is an absence of record, not a
  record of no cost), G13 (the feeds' horizon is the cut, the standard's the year) and G16. Layer 2 family
  `estimation_fit` (censoring and truncation), pattern `own:a stay billed at its end carried at the member cap from
  its daily professional charges`.
- **World:** architecture 13's (the Larrowbrook Physician Network, its thirteen practices and the three payers, all
  invented, the names screened before the pack was cut), with inpatient care made whole in both years: every stay
  carries the attending physicians' daily professional claims, its facility claim is billed at discharge and paid
  after it, a few long stays in 2025 (neonatal and intensive care) close before the 2025 cut and show the whole pattern
  with their amounts, and ordinary short stays are open at both cuts at every practice.
- **Forcing fact:** the payers' 2027 track elections are due by 30 October 2026, and the board meets on 29 October.
- **The field facts the mechanism stands on:**
  - Hospitals bill an inpatient stay on one facility claim after discharge; physicians bill their inpatient visits
    day by day as professional claims, paid on the professional lag while the stay runs.
  - A payer's completion factors complete the month's amounts as the lag history arrived on average; they hold no
    knowledge of a particular stay that is still running.
  - A value-based finance team carries the large claims it already knows of separately from the completion of the rest,
    and a member cap (stop-loss) fixes a known catastrophic case's contribution once it has passed the cap.
- **Data-native sentence:** the October feeds hold every claim paid by 30 September, so a stay still running on 31
  August is in them only as its physicians' daily visits; the facility claim comes after discharge and, for the
  neonatal and trauma stays open at the cut, already exceeds the member cap on the per-day amounts the 2025 stays of
  the same kind were paid at.
- **The WHAT screen.** Population, outcome, unit, window and comparison are architecture 13's, filed in the standard
  and the resolution; the decisive step settles none of them: it is what the October feeds do not yet hold for the
  members already in them, which no record states and no rule asks for.
- **Same-puzzle and same-driver tests:** (time, G12, designation_set) repeats task231, task234 v2 and task445's first
  loop, older than the last twelve, differentiated on the card; (time, G12, etl_conformance) no match.
- **Abstraction test:** the nearest drivers stripped of nouns: this slot's architecture 13 (0.16) carries a population
  that fills by contact, now the default path's run-out; task232 (0.08) estimates a rate per unit of exposure from
  closed episodes; task483 (0.07) rebuilds quantities recorded at a coarser grain. None turns on an episode whose amount
  is written only at its end and is already fixed by a cap.

## Architecture 13 record (spent 2026-10-25)

Architecture 13 elected the Larrowbrook Physician Network's 2027 two-sided track practices: each practice's 2026
network measure on the payers' final 2026 attribution, projected from the October interim run by the practice's own
2025 run-out at the same cut, against the default path that takes the interim measure as the 2026 figure (Ostrelwood,
Thornelfield and Jesselford alone, against the golden nine). At stage 4 round 1 (zip ab79a5f44c18f637) both scored
readers landed the call (exit 1): each read the prompt's "projected to the payers' final 2026 attribution" beside the
standard's attribution rules as a population the October run cannot hold, re-ran the October 2025 interim run on the
2025 claims with the standard's own rules and the Appendix C factors, and carried each practice's interim measure by
its own 2025 final-to-interim ratio. Reader A kept all 78 ask figures (Kesselcrest's reviewed 99215 visits at the
99214 rate out of level 5, Merrinlake's halved modifier-25 visits counted by their code, Pemberglen's coverage month
from its payment reference, Kesselcrest's Medicare Advantage lines at 6.50 out); reader B kept every benchmark,
threshold and ask B figure and no ask A figure. The judge thread was stopped at the spend. Asked to project an interim
figure to a final one, a careful reader takes last year's interim-to-final ratio, the field's completion reflex, and a
standard whose rules can be re-run on last year's claims hands it that ratio in one pass.

## Architecture 12 record (spent 2026-10-24)

Architecture 12 certified the Quillmere Lake basin's 2027 Seasonal Communities Aid: each city's average population
present in its busiest month of the measurement year read from its plant's influent BOD load divided by the load per
person its own January to April 2026 fix, against the default path that counts residents plus the paid stays the fee
returns and both platforms record (Sorrelton and Esker Narrows alone, USD 1,200,000 each, against the golden's five
cities at USD 480,000 each). At stage 4 round 1 (zip be45d7b75ea5cc24) both scored readers landed the call (exit 1):
each read the Act's "every other person staying in or visiting the city" as a population no record holds, went to the
one file that measures everyone (the plants' influent), divided the load by 0.17 lb a person a day (the population
equivalent the world had been tuned to agree with), checked it against the residents in winter and filed the five
cities; both also counted Kettle & Pine's nights back from the departure in its reference (reader A all 32 of ask A,
reader B 26 of 32 on half-dollar rounding) and missed only the pond systems' flow basis in ask B. The judge thread was
stopped at the spend. A statute that defines the population as everyone present, beside records that plainly hold
only the paid stays, sends a careful reader looking for a measure of everyone, and a pack whose influent rows have
no other use hands it one.

## Architecture 11 record (spent 2026-10-24)

Architecture 11 settled Lumenfold Learning's 2025-26 outcomes guarantee district by district, each partner district's
share of eligible students at or above Proficient on a matrix-sampled spring science assessment re-estimated from its
students' own two-module answers with the district in the population model, against the default path that averages
the contractor's five plausible values by district (19 districts owed USD 32,045.00 against the golden's 16 owed
USD 25,493.75). At stage 4 round 1 both scored readers missed the call, reader A kept all of ask A through the
catalog's hours per session, and the judge's pass 1 returned FIX_NOW on a cent tie in the credits (seat prices moved to
whole half dollars). In round 2 reader C refitted the 2PL latent regression from the item responses with district in
the conditioning model, validated it on the contractor's Table 6, filed the golden 16 districts and USD 25,493.75 and
kept every ask figure: a conditioning model that leaves out the grouping variable is a reflex for a reader who knows
plausible values, so the architecture was spent.

## Architecture 10 record (spent 2026-10-24)

Architecture 10 accrued each Medicare hospice provider number's FY2026 aggregate cap repayment at the December 2026
close, each beneficiary counted under the proportional method on the days to come from their state at the close (an
open stay by its length so far, a live discharge by its time out, returns read at every hospice from the benefit
periods extract), against the default path that runs the open stays on and takes the live discharges as finished
(Fallowmere USD 0.3 million against nothing). At stage 4 all four isolated readers across two rounds missed the call
and the round 1 judge returned DETERMINISTIC, APPROVE; the round 2 judge returned NOT_DETERMINISTIC, SEND_BACK
(margin_or_boundary_fragility and competing_defensible_answer): the printed 0.3 needed Fallowmere's count inside a
window of 2.9 beneficiaries while independent builds of the projection scattered about a beneficiary either way, and
the pool start, the number of later elections and the Kaplan-Meier tail were left unfiled (0.248 to 0.447 on the
judge's variants); ask A's routine-paid days read as an unstated rule. A designation set would have held (every variant
put Fallowmere above its cap); a figure printed to USD 0.1 million on a three-beneficiary window did not.

## Architecture 9 record (spent 2026-10-23)

Architecture 9 read each station's Schedule C availability from the bikes in working order docked, each bike's spells
rebuilt from the trips and fleet moves and a bike counted out of working order from the end of the ride that left it
when renters passed it over and a van then took it to the depot for a day or more, against the status feed's available
count (W-02, W-12, W-16 and W-19 against W-16 alone). At stage 4 (zip 14ceb178) both scored readers missed the call:
reader A subtracted the reported bikes and the bikes mechanics took in without a report, inside the inspection windows
(W-16 and W-19); reader B subtracted the reported bikes only (W-16). Both kept nearly every ask figure (65 and 64 of 74,
exit 1): the sales export's present-location column undone through the work orders' terminal replacements, and the
alarms ended at restarts once the clear pairing ran to hundreds of hours with sales inside them. The isolated judge
thread returned NOT_DETERMINISTIC, SEND_BACK, competing_defensible_answer (Gates B, C and E): no shipped file says that
unreported broken bikes exist or how to find them, so the records read literally (the feed, or the rebuild with the
reported bikes out) file W-16 alone, and the depot-stay cut and the pass test sit only in the solution's steps (at 36
and 48 hours W-17 and W-19 move by a point); Gate G `planted_defect_flip`, `surface_read_rejection`,
`surface_read_dependency: yes`, `sole_data_defect: yes`; Gate H `decisive_step: planted`.

## Architecture 8 record (spent 2026-10-23)

Architecture 8 carried each store's data logger record through the vaccine's thermal lag, a first-order response
fitted per logger make on the two weeks each pilot store's old logger kept recording beside its new in-carton sensor
(42.2, 42.2 and 41.9 minutes), against the loggers' readings taken as the vaccine's temperature (six stores against
ten). At stage 4 (zip ad958ec9) reader B set the pilot stores' loggers beside their in-carton sensors over the overlap
unprompted, fitted the lag as a first-order filter (0.21 of the gap closed per ten minutes, about 42 minutes) and
landed the six stores and every store's whole hours, answering question 6 "an analytical choice" on standard 7.2; it
kept every ask figure too (122 of 122 graded figures, exit 1): the counts' own closing times, the credits found when
per-item balances went negative, the vial write-offs by cost over the per-dose cost, the tax switch by the
maintenance-only invoices at Schedule B's prices, and the two-store routes split by Schedule B. Reader A and the judge
thread were stopped at the spend.

## Architecture 7 record (spent 2026-10-23)

Architecture 7 read each production day's oxidizer outlet from the relation the ten oxidizers' tests trace (a floor of
about 45 ppmv as carbon, 1.8 per cent of the inlet above about 2,500) at the inlet the day's captured VOC and airflow
imply, against each plant's latest test efficiency (Ashcombe 21 and Kelvedon 20 against 29 and 28). At stage 4 (zip
5ab18e48) reader A read the floor straight off the test tables (Ashcombe's 2018 two-press test holds the same 45 ppmv
at half the inlet), rebuilt each hour's outlet as the greater of the floor and 1.8 per cent of the inlet and landed the
five and all 14 whole tons, Part 2 question 1 "none" and question 6 "an analytical choice"; reader B carried each
fixed-fan unit's test outlet to the year through the register's fan-drive column (R4, six plants). Both readers kept
all 28 ask figures: the revision log read, the payment lines parsed, Haldane matched on description. The judge thread
was stopped at the spend.

## Architecture 6 record (spent 2026-10-22)

Architecture 6 set Form 27A's placement scores from the bank difficulties carried from the old platform's field-test
section (positions 61 to 70) to the positions 21 to 70 the unique items take on Northgate Assess, by the position term
the 2026 attempts measure, against the default path's difficulties as filed (29 and 18 against 30 and 19). At stage 4
reader A rebuilt every response at its delivered position, fitted the Rasch model with the anchor block fixed, found
items harder later in the test on both platforms and landed 30 and 19 exactly (29.48 and 18.50), Part 2 question 1
"none" and question 6 "an analytical choice"; it kept 13 of 62 ask figures (the system totals and some twice counts).
Reader B and the judge thread were stopped at the spend.

## Architecture 5 record (spent 2026-10-22)

Architecture 5 designated rapid price growth areas on each dwelling type's own year effect weighted by the census
stock's value, with a pooled hedonic year term as the default path. At stage 4 both readers and the judge's own
derivation took the type-by-stock aggregation by reflex (type medians or type year effects weighted by the census
stock) and missed the call only on the location control (electoral division), which the judge read as unfiled; filing
it hands all three the call, so the decisive step as designed does not stump and the one that held is a fork.

## Tried and rejected
- Architecture 6, item position effects in pre-equating (2026-10-22, spent at stage 4): reader A fitted a Rasch model
  with a position term to the rebuilt attempts and carried the field-test difficulties to Form 27A's positions,
  unprompted by any sentence. The calibration context has to be recoverable for the truth to be fair (the report's
  delivery section and both exports' positions), and once it is, an analyst who knows the field checks the effect the
  context invites; a context effect measured by an obvious model term is a reflex for the field's own analysts.
- Architecture 6 draw (2026-10-22): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement) with a fresh world. Screened
  before it and dead: a CEMS gap fill on load (guard BLOCK on pattern G12 and strategy population_selection against
  task273, same-puzzle and same-driver spent in five to seven builds, the statutory filing against task249);
  multiplicative against additive seasonality (task146, task147); a moving holiday (task162, task467, task135);
  Denton benchmarking (this slot, below); retroactive eligibility as a denominator still developing (the completion
  driver of task451 and task479 v5); Fellegi-Sunter frequency weights (set aside at task486's draw against task468's
  linker error); the oldest old by extinct generations (task228); non-detects under several limits (task189).
- Architecture 5, the stock's price change as each dwelling type's own year effect weighted by the census stock's
  value (2026-10-22, spent at stage 4): both readers and the judge's first derivation weighted dwelling types by the
  census stock by reflex (the note's "dwellings the 2022 census counts" and the census workbook by type invite it) and
  missed only on the electoral-division control, which the judge read as unfiled (r5a); filing it hands them the call.
  A stock aggregation over a tabulated type mix is a reflex once the stock is the filed population.
- Architecture 5 draw (2026-10-22): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement); the world and pack of architecture 4 kept, the decisive step moved from the constant-quality regression its reader 9 found to the aggregation that regression skips (each type's own year effect over the stock's value), with the pooled regression now the default path. At registration the v4 identity BLOCKed on own_lineage, gap population on same-puzzle and same-driver (task251 v5), shape 10 and the statutory filing (task249 v6) and filed_standard (task478 v4); redrawn as recorded in the Draw, the circular changed to settle the 2027 fund allocations.
- Ask B's reissued student ids as a 7-digit id equal to the old one plus a campus constant, linked by birth date, sex and ZIP (2026-10-21, stage 4 round 1): both readers resolved it on the person columns and kept all six headcounts (score_reader 50 per cent); re-sited so the new ids share the old form with no arithmetic tie, birth date, sex and ZIP are shared by different students, and the movers' majors are recoded, so only the four-field key resolves it.
- Architecture 1, a coordinating board's instructional grant with four parents' consolidated returns apportioned by a cost model (2026-10-21, spent at stage 4): round 1's two readers split by FTE or total credit hours and missed; both round 2 readers fitted instruction expense on credit hours by level across the standalone campuses, split each parent's return by the modelled cost and landed the call (exit 1). Pricing activity by level from the units that report alone is a strong reader's reflex once the activity file by level ships beside the combined return.
- Architecture 2, regional register error rates from an audit drawn unequally by a risk screen (2026-10-21, spent at stage 4): both readers checked the audit's composition against the register (35 per cent referred against 8), weighted each stratum to the 30 April register and landed the call; both also read the UTC times into local time and dropped the restored companies (asks 28 of 28). A sample whose composition differs from its frame on a shipped flag is reweighted by a strong reader; a stated clock and a restoration notice are seen devices.
- Architecture 3, registration offices put on a timeliness plan from a quarter's median working days with part of the quarter still open at the extract (2026-10-21, spent at stage 4): both readers censored the open applications at their age, took the Kaplan-Meier median and landed the call, and dated payments by the batch terminal day (asks 28 of 28). An open caseload shipped beside a duration cohort, with a paper saying the open ones count, is read as right-censored by a strong reader; a settlement batch file carrying the terminal day is a seen device.
- Architecture 4, areas' house price change for the rapid price growth designation read from a shifting sample of the stock (2026-10-21, spent at stage 4): reader 9 fitted log price on type, floor area, age, newness and the address point file's electoral division with a year term and landed the call; reader 10 left location out and missed; the block purchases' one consideration on every line held both readers (0 ask totals of 32). A constant-quality index is a strong reader's reflex once the note cites the handbook and the attributes ship; location one join away is not a hidden dimension.
- A district's register error rise tested with the spread of the audit's sampled blocks (2026-10-21, screened at the draw): the guard put it beside task261 (subgroup statistics from one clustered sample, their difference's error from the clusters), the same driver.
- Regional quarterly output benchmarked to annual totals by Denton against pro-rata (2026-10-21, screened): Denton's extrapolation holds the end-of-year ratio, which sits within a few tenths of a point of pro-rata's annual ratio, while a trending ratio puts the truth far from both; the separation is too small and the truth not recoverable without forecasting the ratio.
- Architecture 7 draw (2026-10-23): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement) with a fresh world.
  Screened before it and dead: gross labour-force flows corrected for reinterview misclassification (task244's
  driver); speededness on a timed form (task249's screen); a winner's curse in form assembly (task471's shrinkage
  coin flip); generic price erosion by entrant count (task484 v1's ramp, screened at task478's draw); percent-of-charges
  hospital contracts carried to each hospital's current chargemaster (the swap test reads it as any list-price
  contract); laboratory results harmonised by proficiency-test bias (the reported result is the measurement, so the
  correction is a fork); a cancer registry's completeness by the flow method (task249's screen); common-stack
  apportionment from single-unit hours (task263's unmixing); a concentration-discharge load (task452 v1, task135);
  change of support for block grades (task270, task254, task273 screens); linkage on an address the outcome changes
  (task468's linker error); calculator-type DIF and released-item drift on the item bank (architecture 6's lesson: a
  context an obvious model term measures).
- v7 stage 3, 2026-10-23: the first tuning let each oxidizer's test outlet carried to the year (its concentration on
  each day's air, or its rate over the year's hours) file the golden five, because a fixed-fan plant at the floor emits
  the same rate every day; Larkmoor Graphics was made a concentrated-test, mostly-dilute plant under 25 tons so those
  routes file six (R4, R4m, R4b).
- v7 stage 3, 2026-10-23: press VOC to one decimal: the standing family spreads up to 0.37 tons on a plant, so the
  figure is graded in whole tons, every member 0.19 tons or more from a half (G4); the CSV's used and captured
  columns went with it (free to both top responses), the CSV now the press VOC and coverage.
- v7 stage 3, 2026-10-23: the tuned plants landed on whole tons (29.00, 37.00); moved to ordinary offsets (G5). Days
  below the tests' lowest inlet at three plants opened an extrapolation fork (interpolated efficiency against the
  floor); the low days were raised inside the tested range.
- Architecture 7, 2026-10-23: spent at stage 4. The decisive relation was visible inside one oxidizer's own tests (the
  same outlet at two inlets) and in the register's fan-drive column, and a regenerative oxidizer's outlet floor is
  field knowledge both readers carried; the asks' devices each sat one file away from a careful reader's path (the
  master's revision log in the same workbook, the washer gallons in readable payment text, descriptions beside the
  renumbered items). Next architecture: a decisive step no table displays as a pattern and no column labels.
- Architecture 8 draw (2026-10-23): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement) with a fresh world, aimed
  at architecture 7's lesson (no table displays the decisive relation, no column labels it). Screened before it and
  dead: vessel propulsion from AIS speed over ground carried to speed through the water by an estuary's tidal streams
  (a port world beside task472 and task474, and a tidal stream table has no other use in an emissions pack, so its
  presence announces the correction); container ships' at-berth auxiliary load by the reefers on board, calibrated on
  shore power meters (a port world, and a reader calibrating on the meters sees the per-call spread with reefers its
  first explanation); a tanker's boiler load at berth by its own steam cargo pumps on discharge (the at-berth tanker
  rules' own reasoning, a reflex once the transfer log is joined); dairy lagoon methane through the lagoon's
  temperature lag behind the air (the rate model is a filed procedure, and four inspection readings a year cannot fix
  the lag deterministically); switcher locomotives' idling through the start-stop system's restart temperature (a
  rate carried across a weather covariate, task478 v7's driver); crematory mercury by the decedents' dental cohort (a
  composition mix one survey table hands over); breaker SF6 leak rates from temperature-uncompensated pressures (the
  gas temperature at each reading is not recoverable). A cold-chain prototype (thirty-six refrigerators, probe 6 minutes,
  carton 48) put the logger's own hours at two to ten times the vaccine's, the default qualifying 29 against 12, with
  a 45-minute lag fitted on ten fourteen-day overlaps at 0.04 degrees C reproducing the carton's set exactly, while 30
  and 60 minute duration filters (17 and 6) and a 45-minute moving average (20) fell elsewhere and a 90-minute moving
  average missed by one refrigerator: the stage 2 world keeps the default's count plausible and every store clear of the
  line under the standing family.
- v8 stage 3, 2026-10-23: standard 7.1 first read "the records of each store's device of record are its vaccine
  temperature records", which a literal reader takes as the logger's readings being the vaccine's temperature (an
  official decoy for the default path); it became a records-custody clause.
- v8 stage 3, 2026-10-23: under the interval-mean reading of a record's vaccine temperature five stores' whole hours
  moved by one while the call held; 7.3 now files the counting (a record counts its ten minutes by the vaccine's
  temperature at its time stamp), WHAT and not HOW (SF17).
- v8 stage 3, 2026-10-23: return credits from both manufacturers put the cracker's balance below zero at eleven
  stores, a loud failure that points at the double count; only Halvorsen's standard-dose products are returnable, the
  leftovers leaner and the unrecorded losses scaled to each store's volume (cracker 15 doses or more, A6).
- v8 stage 3, 2026-10-23: maintenance-only invoices at one price per unit type tied ten stores' service figures (a
  constant response would have kept them); per-model prices and add-on parts at some visits, every store's figure now
  distinct (B5). With the tax switch as ask B's only silent device a reader who found it kept 23 to 30 of 30; the
  pre-move two-store maintenance routes on one invoice were added, so the tax switch alone keeps 10.
- v8 stage 3, 2026-10-23: the first names sat on real organisations, products or places in or near the field (H21):
  Coldline (a refrigeration manufacturer), Polarwatch (an ocean-data programme), Vaxtor, Homeline, Arctis, Glacier
  Medical, and the acquired chains Rookwood Drug and Saltash Apothecary; renamed Tellvane, Brumal, Stellane, Keswell,
  Brannon, Pendry Medical, Vollmer Drug and Lindqvist Apothecary before any reader saw the pack.
- Architecture 8, 2026-10-23: spent at stage 4. Two instruments recording one unit side by side are compared by a
  strong reader on reflex: the pilot stores' logger and in-carton series parted at every restock and defrost swing, so
  reader B fitted a first-order lag on the overlap with no sentence asking for it. Every ask device had one natural
  check that exposed it (per-item balances, cost per unit, a list price met exactly, one invoice on two sites).
  Next architecture: a decisive step whose evidence no single side-by-side comparison shows, and ask devices that no
  per-item reconciliation or unit-price check reveals.
- Architecture 9 draw (2026-10-23): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement) with a fresh world. Screened before it and set aside: phantom shelf inventory under a vendor-managed availability guarantee (on-shelf availability is an industry term that names its own correction); a plan directory's ghost providers read from claims (the directory and the claims sit side by side, architecture 8's reflex); a starting dose as the mark of a true initiator in an outcomes contract (population_selection, in the window against task275); rectifying inspection's over-weighted rejected lots (population_selection again); left truncation of a fleet's lifetimes (task133's delayed entry for a taken-over book); GPS chord distance by terrain for fuel-tax jurisdiction miles (the call would sit on a few per cent of one state's miles); meter error read off a system balance (the instrument-bias family task478 v5 and task480 v1 lost to readers); charger uptime from failed sessions (the failure is written in the session record itself). The bike-share draw keeps the listed count correct for what the operator knew and puts the difference in renters' choices, which no record states.
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: the fleet's clock ran four hours off Eastern time after the move to absolute instants (its
  local minute of the day counted from midnight UTC), so the pack showed the morning rush at noon; the window's start was
  re-anchored to 20:00 on 23 September so the fleet's own clock is Eastern time, the trajectory byte for byte the same
  (46,883 trips), the station move and the dock expansions read at 23:00, and Schedule C's minutes taken from Eastern
  time itself; the designations held (W-16 alone against W-02, W-12, W-16, W-19).
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: each station's three months to one decimal put nine of 72 cells within two minutes of a
  printed edge and W-12's lowest month (87.652) within a minute; graded at each station's lowest month in whole per cent
  instead (the tightest ten minutes clear, M1), the margin to one decimal (0.684, eleven minutes), the monthly figures
  kept in the workbook as context.
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: ask B's hours to one decimal put W-18 within a second of an edge; graded in whole hours, each
  pay station's alarm stream chosen so its figure sits 0.08 hours or more inside its bin (M3).
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: the union of overlapping alarms as ask B's device: at whole hours the summed and merged
  spans print alike at every station; kept as texture (B3), the restarts carrying the device.
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: with only the alarms and restarts in the log, ending an open alarm at the pay station's next
  event of any kind kept 15 of 24 hours figures (the restart was nearly always the next event), an honest pair of 45.7;
  the cabinet heater's events on cold days and the service door at reader repairs added, the shortcut keeps 4 (33.1).
- v9 stage 2, 2026-10-23: invented names screened by web search (Wellhaven, Northlane Mobility, Corlund Kiosk
  Systems): no organisation, product or place on any of them in or near the field; Welland, Ontario is three edits away.
- Architecture 9, 2026-10-23: spent at stage 4 on the judge's SEND_BACK. A count the operator's system publishes as
  available, read against a state no record holds (a bike's working order inferred from what renters and the vans did
  with it), is a surface read rejected however the evidence is gathered: on clean data the feed would be right, so the
  judge files Gate G surface_read_rejection and Gate H planted, and with nothing filed saying unreported faults exist
  the records read literally give the feed's answer (competing_defensible_answer). The readers missed the call for the
  same reason the judge refused it. Both ask devices were found: a column filled from a present-day register is undone
  by a work-order log that lists every swap, and a pairing that runs alarms to hundreds of hours with sales inside them
  announces its own repair. Next architecture: a quantity every file visibly lacks (so no surface read stands in for it),
  estimated by a method the data forces, and ask devices whose wrong reading is plausible rather than absurd and whose
  evidence no log lists outright.
- Architecture 10 draw (2026-10-23), no card filed. The guard's window closes survey research for ETL (ban.pairing and
  ban.subdomain against task483, so census-register and seasonal adjustment are both out) and the strategies grain_or_unit,
  population_selection and composition_mix (task483, task275, task179); payment claims, emissions, IRT equating and data
  integration clear it. Screened on those four and dead on file or on measurement: competing exits against censoring
  (task169, task266; the competing exit is a reflex, task133); pooled-test infection rates (task188); age-length keys
  (post-stratification, a reflex once the aged subsample's design ships); a pooled tail share from parts' means and spreads
  (task483's lesson); a population's share past a cut from short matrix-sampled booklets (task464's shrinkage lesson);
  direct against indirect adjustment of a net series (task453 v2's fork); time-series consistency by splicing (task123's
  screen); chance agreement on name and birth date in a voter roll (task468's common-identifier lesson); credibility for
  site emission factors (the regulatory standard takes the site's own tests, a fork); tracer flux ratios (the integrated
  ratio is the method's own definition, so the default is the golden); flows traced through intermediaries to end markets
  (task451 v1's swap failure); uncompensated gas meters (a unit read, data semantics); correlated systematic errors in an
  activity-data uncertainty (the call is a monitoring decision, Data Quality); cohort waits from cumulative counts under
  first-in-first-out (generic queueing, the swap reads the same); a pick log matched to put-aways by each lane's access
  order (drive-in lanes are last-in-first-out, field knowledge a strong reader carries, architecture 7's death).
- Architecture 10 draw (2026-10-24): drawn on the hospice cap after a second screen of the four open ETL task types (survey research still closed by task483). Screened and dead: TRI range codes valued at the exact filings inside each range (the midpoint is the programme's own convention, a competing defensible answer, and the exact filings are one group-by away); charge compression in cost-plus repricing (the implant invoices put the cost-to-charge ratio against the charge in plain view, and the functional form forks); a stopped turbine's nacelle anemometer read through the running transfer function (readers impute from neighbours by habit, and Gate G reads an instrument bias as planted); unconstrained demand on sell-out days (the product-limit estimator is a reflex and converges with the intraday route); time-of-observation bias in daily maxima (the calendar-day maximum is not recoverable from a 5 p.m. reset and the nearest hourly station); trend uncertainty with shared emission factors (propagating through the difference carries the shared factor by construction, so the easy route is right); items dropped from scoring rescored through the test characteristic curve (the published conversion table replays the method); best-of-k seed reports deflated by each recipe's seed spread (the client's GSDS Layer 1 list names best seed against mean as harmonisation); inverter clipping, demand ratchets and dead-time counting losses (each leaves a flat top or a ceiling in the records that announces its correction); unit value against a fixed-basket price index for provider unit cost (composition_mix, banned against task179 for this registration); DIF purification, testing-window instruction time and single-group order effects in equating (field reflexes, or no bias in the equating); register status nowcast by a Markov chain (forecasting, and architecture 9's surface-read refusal); interpolation along a process curve between sparse readings (task478 v6's and task480's degradation and life-cycle families). The first card draft BLOCKed on test.same_puzzle against task171 v4 with G13 decisive; G12 is the honest decisive generator for the step that decides.
- v10 stage 2, 2026-10-24: a lifetime projection with Brackwater, Lindmoor and Wexmoor owing beside Fallowmere: the
  standing family (Aalen-Johansen or empirical return chances, three valuations of a return, the open stays' later
  returns overall or from their time so far) moves each core program's cap by USD 30,000 to 70,000 against cells of
  USD 100,000, and the overall-rate route kept three of the four amounts; the core programs were placed under the cap
  and Fallowmere carries the call alone (nothing accrued on the default path, USD 0.3 million on the golden).
- v10 stage 2, 2026-10-24: pooled models across provider numbers and a split by discharge reason each moved
  Fallowmere's count by up to 1.3 per cent on cells of small programs; the policy files the reference class (the same
  provider number and diagnosis group), and Fallowmere's seller's system records no revocation against discharge
  reason, so the reason split is not available for its history.
- v10 stage 2, 2026-10-24: with return stays as long as first stays the overall rate times the census average landed
  the golden's cell (0.325 against 0.300); re-elections run shorter (the beneficiary comes back in decline) and seldom
  end alive again, so that route files 0.53 and the census-average valuation by time out 0.19.
- v10 stage 2, 2026-10-24: the outside share of Fallowmere's returns was raised from a third to four in five, so the
  route that reads returns from Elderglen's own records files nothing (cap ratio 0.971) instead of landing beside the
  golden.
- v10 stage 3, 2026-10-24: the organisation and program names Elderglen, Brackwater, Corrinbrook, Dunsmere, Lindmoor,
  Pennacott, Sallowfield and Wexmoor sat within two edits of real places in the GeoNames register (Eden Glen,
  Blackwater, Swallowfield and Fallowfield, Dunmore and Dinsmore, Wyndmoor, Dixmoor) or carried a place word (Penna,
  and Cornbrook in Manchester two edits from Corrinbrook); renamed Wendleglen, Brindlemoor, Corvelfield, Darrelbrook,
  Marrellford, Rennickdale, Varrowmere and Farrinridge in the generator, every figure unchanged. The lines above keep the
  names they were written with.
- v10 stage 4 round 1, 2026-10-24: both scored readers missed the call (each ran the open stays on and took the
  live discharges as finished, nothing accrued) and the judge returned DETERMINISTIC, APPROVE (Gate G analytical, Gate H
  pass); reader A joined the claim lines to the remittance register and kept all 24 ask A figures (exit 1), so the
  device that the latest version is not the paid one sat off the careful path. Re-sited: the contractor's prepayment
  review pays some held inpatient days at the routine rate, visible only by repricing the paid version, with the
  returned replacements kept as a hazard and moved more than 118 days before the close (reader B had priced them as
  pending, cutting payments); the census report's length-of-stay table, blank on a group key mismatch, now prints.
- v10 stage 4 round 2, 2026-10-24, architecture spent: both fresh scored readers again missed the call (open stays
  run on, live discharges finished, nothing accrued) and kept 0 of 24 ask figures, but the judge thread returned
  NOT_DETERMINISTIC, SEND_BACK (margin_or_boundary_fragility, competing_defensible_answer): Fallowmere's printed 0.3
  needs its count inside 177.6 to 180.5, a window of 2.9 beneficiaries (USD 0.1 million at the cap amount and 98 per
  cent), while independent builds of the same projection scatter about a beneficiary either way (0.248 to 0.311 on the
  judge's variants, 0.279 to 0.314 on the standing family), and it named four choices the policy leaves open (the
  Kaplan-Meier tail, one later election or several, stays begun before 1 October 2016, the last provider number when the
  open stay is at another hospice); it also read ask A's routine-paid days as an unstated counting rule. Lesson: a cap
  repayment printed to USD 0.1 million moves a cell every 2.9 beneficiaries of count, so a projection whose honest
  spread is a beneficiary cannot print one cell; the next architecture's call has to be a quantity whose cell is wider
  than its estimator family's spread, measured on independent builds rather than on the author's own family.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 11 draw, screened on paper before any code against v10's lesson (a call whose cell is wider
  than its estimators' measured spread): Medicare Advantage post-payment recoupments or denial overturns for a
  hospital's 2027 contract notices carry v10's latent structure (a terminal-looking state that is not final) and
  task451's (amounts still to arrive).
- Architecture 11 draw: Medicaid procedural reinstatements and COBRA retroactive elections: retroactive eligibility was
  screened at task451 and task479 v5, and COBRA's selection is population_selection, banned against task275.
- Architecture 11 draw: ACA risk adjustment transfers estimated from competitors' public prior-year transfers: carrying
  a competitor's risk forward is a fork; ACA grace-period cures: rule-heavy, with the cure rate carried across the 2026
  subsidy expiry.
- Architecture 11 draw: censored transplant costs by inverse probability of censoring weights: mature cohorts are
  unbiased without a trend, and a trend makes the stump a dated step; authorization- or ADT-based claims reserves: the
  completion family, and a leading indicator is a reflex.
- Architecture 11 draw: price-standardised total cost of care tiers: the standardisation is a WHAT (filed is rule
  application, unfiled a fork); deductible leveraging is task479 v3's driver; prescription abandonment by out-of-pocket
  cost: the lever is too small; stop-loss and high-cost claimant pooling: non-linear aggregation at claimant level and
  level-dependent counts are closed.
- Architecture 11 draw: hospital coding intensity after an EHR conversion, separated by the same patients' successive
  admissions: adjacent to task453 (a measurement change read from a within-design contrast that nets a drift), the event
  study is the reflex and the WHAT signposts the method.
- Architecture 11 draw: low-voltage anode effect PFCs at aluminium potlines: task459's driver (a ratio with a fixed
  component carried across activity levels), and the IPCC slope method files it; wastewater digester relief-valve
  venting: v9's Gate G risk (an unmetered event inferred from indirect evidence); idle and shut-in wells: a setting clone
  of task462 and task450 v1; stack test-day tune-ups: population_selection and a surface read.
- Architecture 11 draw: a landfill's pre-record waste read from the volume survey: the gas collection record calibrates
  the decay model and absorbs the missing waste; refinery turnaround cycles: a schedule in a file is read; fuel switched
  during gas curtailments: a degree-day normalisation is the reflex.
- Architecture 11 draw: Fellegi-Sunter term-frequency weights: adjacent to task468 (false links on common
  identifiers); address agreement decaying with the gap between records: adjacent to task468 v1.
- Architecture 11 draw: majority-drifted or released anchors (v6, task450); rater severity drift on a shared
  constructed-response subset (task471 v2's driver); rapid guessing in a low-stakes sitting (task479 v4, sent back as
  cleaning contaminated data); speededness and not-reached items (an anchor-drift screen catches them).
- Architecture 11 draw: queue position for open appeals or a coding backlog against timely filing limits: the waiting
  time is a generic queue quantity, so the swap test fails and the domain is a backdrop; censored demand behind
  capacity is task18, task108 and task168; capture-recapture is task199, task243, task248 and task448.
- Architecture 11 draw: newborns and deliveries predicted from current pregnancies in an employer group's renewal: the
  base projection's credibility and trend choices fork, in a large group last year's deliveries already carry the
  component, and the honest strategy (who is in the 2027 population) is population_selection, banned against task275.
- Architecture 11 draw: race and ethnicity imputed from surname and geography for group counts: summing the
  probabilities is the reflex for counts, and the weighting-against-regression choice for rates needs a gold-standard
  subsample, banned against task275.
- Architecture 11 draw: the payroll survey's birth-death model against the lagged QCEW census is reserved for task484
  v2, and drawing it here through a house domain would game the survey x ETL ban against task483.
- Architecture 11 draw, first world: plausible values aggregated by school for a county school system's coaching list
  reskins task450's world and call (a district's own assessment naming the campuses below a share for coaching), so the
  mechanism moved to a company's guarantee settlement with its partner districts.
- Architecture 11 placement, benchmarks by prior tercile (12 to 20 for the lowest, up to 30 for the highest): no
  district the plausible values pull down could cross a benchmark it met, since the strong-implementation districts
  with weak backgrounds sit in the lowest tercile, so benchmarks became whole numbers from 12 to 35 per order form.
- Architecture 11 placement, a 5.5-point margin to the family's envelope with 2.5 points of crossing for every route:
  no maximum likelihood or curve-inversion count crossed anywhere, the routes' upward bias peaking near 9 points; the
  shipped margin is 4 points to the whole family's envelope with 1.5 to 3 points of crossing by route.
- Architecture 11 asks, a series' total on each row with series of up to 12 hours: the hours column summed put most
  districts at two to three times their contract, which reads as wrong at a glance; the series were cut to 3 and 4
  hours and the summer institute booked by day.
- Architecture 11 ask A, the offering's catalog hours on every session row (a series' total on each of its sessions):
  round 1's reader A set the series rows beside the catalog's hours per session and replaced them, keeping all 58 hours
  and 18 credits (exit 1); the catalog every reader opens for the live and recorded formats holds the tell one lookup
  away. Re-sited onto the session times the scheduler holds as hours and minutes after the point, every offering
  scheduled in whole hours so only the sessions that ran short or long carry minutes.
- Architecture 11, credits on quarter-dollar seat prices: a 15 per cent credit on a fee of 11,537.50 is 1,730.625, so the
  cent had a tie that no file breaks (judge pass 1, FIX_NOW); seat prices moved to whole half dollars, every credit a
  whole cent, the call's set unchanged.
Architecture 11 (the contractor's plausible values drawn from a conditioning model with no district term, each district re-estimated with the district in the model), spent at stage 4 round 2 on zip ce5456c3: reader C refitted the 2PL latent regression from the item responses with district in the conditioning model, validated its fit on the contractor's Table 6, filed the golden 16 districts and USD 25,493.75, and kept every ask figure (58 of 58 hours, 20 of 20 shortfall credits, 36 of 36 memo rows) by reading the hours field as hours and minutes from its fractions. A conditioning model that omits the grouping variable is a reflex for a reader who knows plausible values, so the round-3 PD re-site (series credit hours stacked on h.mm) is moot and the slot re-roots.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 draw: a Lunar New Year factory shutdown reaching a US East Coast port's container imports
  a Pacific or Cape crossing later, for its calendar-adjusted series: the decisive step is a lag and a window, the
  enumerable single choice the client's measured coin flips share, the effect is famous in trade data, and a port world
  would be this lane's third (task472, task474). Not drawn.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 draw: a state's payroll survey estimates early-benchmarked to the lagged unemployment
  insurance census where the birth-death model ran ahead in a slowdown: the two series count the same jobs side by side
  (architecture 8's reflex), the step is a choice between two files, and rejecting the published estimate for the census
  reads as a surface-read rejection at Gate G. Not drawn.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 draw: revisions measured from real-time vintages, or rebuilt pseudo-real-time by
  re-adjusting truncated spans: the client's pin makes the triangle rule application once the vintages ship, and the
  truncated re-adjustment forks between X-11 and STL end filters. A seasonal break from a school calendar moved to
  August: the post-break span is a window and the regime regressors are a reflex. Not drawn.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 draw: chain drift in a scanner-data price index (economics x ETL is undrawable, and the
  formula is one enumerable switch); suppressed county-industry cells rebuilt from their margins (identification is the
  step, so one linear solve is the easy route landing); custom-area margins of error from replicate tables against the
  approximation (the handbook licenses both, a fork at Gate C); register over-coverage by signs of life (every activity
  window is a threshold read as a fork). Not drawn.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 draw: the lake towns' population present also read from their transfer stations' scale
  tickets or their water meters: solid waste is collected on schedules that lag the stays, and summer water use carries
  the irrigation of empty cottages, so neither measures the people present as the sewer does; kept out of the pack.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 12 stage 4: the population present read through the plants' influent load per person,
  calibrated on the winter months; both round 1 readers landed the call at the 0.17 lb population equivalent (exit 1),
  because the Act's definition made the paid-stay records visibly incomplete and the influent rows had no other use in
  the pack. Spent.
- Architecture 13 draw (2026-10-24): re-rooted on the author's standing rule (no retirement) with a fresh world.
  Screened before it and dead: Medicaid exposure developed through retroactive enrollment (task474 v4's capitation
  world, task451 and task479 v5's completion, and the recent months' dip shows on any monthly tabulation); linkage
  sensitivity by identifier stratum for linked mortality (a pooled clerical correction lands the stratified set on
  paper, and stratifying by the identifier is a reflex); three measurement systems combined by triple collocation
  (task228, landed); regression against equating in a score crosswalk (task464); payday counts by weekday schedule
  (task477); data fusion through a small joint source (task465); a prospective capitation priced on experience chosen
  the same way a period earlier (task130's lineage); business deaths confirmed after two years without reactivation
  (the standard's definition makes the adjustment a reflex); out-of-state births to residents arriving through the
  vital records exchange (a completion the place-of-occurrence field shows).
- 2026-10-24, architecture 13 stage 2: the October run's short counts read as members still to come who cost nothing
  (the interim measure scaled by the run's members over the 2025 final run's, or by the member months) filed the golden
  set with the practices as first placed, so a reader who saw the counts and assumed the rest landed the call without
  the 2025 re-run. Birrelhaven, the paediatric clinic whose late members cost nearly what its others cost (run-out
  0.944 on a 22 per cent short count), was placed 5.5 per cent over its threshold, where the zero-cost reading takes it
  12.8 per cent under.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 13 stage 2: asks with one device each (the code on the claim for ask A, Pemberglen's
  posting period for ask B) handed a whole ask to any response that found its device; each ask now carries a second,
  independent silent device (Merrinlake's halved modifier-25 visits; Kesselcrest's Medicare Advantage lines on the same
  remittances), and the best single-device handling keeps 6 of 52 figures.
- 2026-10-24, architecture 13 stage 2: the projected 2026 figure graded to the cent was dropped from the prompt's
  columns: the licensed constructions agree on every election but not on the cents (per payer against per practice
  moves a projection by up to 0.6 per cent), so the workbook carries the projection as context and the rubric grades
  the benchmarks, thresholds and elections.
- 2026-10-25, architecture 13 (each practice's interim measure carried to the payers' final attribution by its own
  2025 run-out at the same cut), spent at stage 4: both scored readers re-ran the October 2025 interim run from the
  2025 claims and landed the call, reader A with all 78 ask figures; a projection from an interim run to a final one
  whose prior-year ratio the standard's own rules rebuild is the completion reflex, and the second ask devices (the
  halved modifier-25 visits, the Medicare Advantage lines at another rate) fell to a reader who checked only the payer
  whose rates looked wrong and the one fee that did not match the standard.
- 2026-10-25, architecture 14 draw: the member cap read as what the run-out truncates (a member whose year to date
  already sits at the cap carries fixed dollars while the year's months grow): in architecture 13's world no member
  reaches USD 250,000 by August and 25 reach USD 100,000 (2.9 per cent of the capped January to August amounts), and a
  practice's capped share moves from one year to the next by noise (about 1.5 per cent of a projection), so no flip
  holds.
- 2026-10-25, architecture 14 draw: competing exits read as censoring (a cumulative incidence against one minus
  Kaplan-Meier) is spent by task134, task254, task257, task264 and task266; a share above a cut counted from scores
  measured with error is task253's driver; random-groups equating with make-up sessions on one form fails on the
  group-equivalence check, which is the field's own quality control and lands by reflex.
